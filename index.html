        <p id="info1">I am a 13 year old girl who wants to be a web developer when by the time I am 18! To get to my goal I started to learn to code at
             the start of this year. My whole life I have been fascinated by computers, coding, and video games. When I was little I wanted 
             to be a youtuber, by the time I was around 11 I realized most people don't just become famous randomly and then I knew I wanted
             to code. After that realization I watned to start making video games. Now that I am 13 I realized I want to be a web developer! 
             I now spend most of my days coding with my laptop in my room. Most people would think that sounds boring or lonely but it is the 
             way I love to spend my time!</p>
